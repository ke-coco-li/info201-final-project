# info201-final-project
## Project Description
- What is the dataset we will be working with?

  + The datasets our team will be working with come from [Zillow Research](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). Specifically, we'll be analyzing Metro Median Rental Prices by Housing Type, Metro Median Household Income, and the Metro Rent Affordability datasets. There are a total of **13** datasets that can be joined together by region id and regionname. Zillow provided these datasets and updates them quarterly.  

- Who is our target audience? What does our audience want to learn from our data? 

  + The target audience for our rental housing visualizations and report would be *current and prospective renters*. We'd like to provide trends and analysis on where rental housing prices are most affordable, how they've changed over the years, and provide other additional information on the current rental housing landscape. 
  
- Some of the questions our project will answer includes:

    + What are the trends of monthly rent in different states by housing types?
    + Based on your income and rent affordability limit, which cities can you afford to live in?
    +

## Technical Description
- How will we be reading in your data?

  + We will be reading it as static CSV files.

- What types of data-wrangling will we need to do to your data?

  + We will combine similar datasets in order to answer specific questions.
  
- What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project?

  + Possible libraries we may be using are:
  
     [Plotly](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/) for scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, area charts, etc...
     
     [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for interactive maps

- What major challenges do we anticipate?

  + We anticipate that the data wrangling portion will be most difficult. It may also be a challenge to figure out how to integrate interactive visualizations into our report.
