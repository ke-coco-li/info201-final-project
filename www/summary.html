    <p>Our report uses data sourced from <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/">Zillow Research</a> to analyze rental information, geared to an audience of American <em>current</em> and <em>prospective</em> renters. There are a total of 13 datasets that can be joined together by region id and regionname. Zillow provided these datasets and updates them quarterly.</p>

    <p>We will read our data using static CSV files obtained from Zillow Research. Types of data-wrangling we do is performing join functions in R Studio to combine our datasets using unique identifiers to make it easier to analyze the data. We also clean our dataset such as identifying Null values. We perform aggregate functions using base R and dpylr to help identify time-based trends and rolling averages from our data. Additionally, we reshape our datasets in order to answer specific questions such as comparing the ratings to months and prices over the years.</p>

    <p>Resources and libraries we use include:
      <li><a href="https://plot.ly/ggplot2/">Plotly</a> for scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, area charts, etc...</li>
      <li><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">Leaflet for R</a> for interactive maps</li>

        <p>
          If you only prefer living in the largest cities, then you can filter out smaller cities. Otherwise, you can show a larger range of sizes of cities if that is not an important for you. After choosing a compatible city size, you can select on the slider to view in overall which areas of the U.S. are affordable. The map will show in general what areas might be more affordable, and the table below gives more detailed information on the regions.

        <p class="subtitle">Rent vs. Sales</p>
        <p>
          After entering a state of interest, you can view the general trends of renting a home monthly compared to the general trends of buying a home. You can use this graph to generalize how much to expect prices of either renting/buying will change, as well as gain some insight on whether renting or buying would be more suited for you.

          After filtering what state, city, and home types you're interested in retrieving data for, the graph outputs a line graph of the median monthly rent from 2010 - 2019. You can use this graph to extrapolate what type of housing will be cheap or expensive in the state you'd like to live in for the next several years.

          Insert your monthly income, then select what percentage of your income you can afford for rent. You can also select a specific type of home you'd like to live in, and a list of cities will show that fits within the amount of money you'd like spend on rent. By adjusting the percentage of your income, and the type of rental, you can use this tool to obtain a general idea of which cities are a good fit.
