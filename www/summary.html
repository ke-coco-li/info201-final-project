    <h5>Based on the size of the city you'd like to live in and rent affordability levels, what cities are best suited for you?</h5>
    <p class="subtitle">Rent affordability map</p>
    <p>
      If you only prefer living in the largest cities, then you can filter out smaller cities. Otherwise, you can show a larger range of sizes of cities if that is not an important for you. After choosing a compatible city size, you can select on the slider the affordability percentage that suits you.

      After filtering what state and home types you're interested in retrieving data for, the graph outputs a line graph of the median monthly rent from 2010 - 2019. You can use this graph to extrapolate what type of housing will be cheap or expensive in the state you'd like to live in for the next several years.
