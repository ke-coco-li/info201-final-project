<p>Our report uses data sourced from <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/">Zillow Research</a> to analyze rental information, geared to an audience of <em>current</em> and <em>prospective</em> renters.</p>

<p class="extra" class="card">We answer multiple interesting questions</p>

<div class="col">
  <div class="card">
    <h5>Based on the size of the city you'd like to live in, what areas are most affordable?</h5>
    <p class="subtitle">Rent affordability map</p>
    <p>
      If you only prefer living in the largest cities, then you can filter out smaller cities. Otherwise, you can show a larger range of sizes of cities if that is not an important for you. After choosing a compatible city size, you can select on the slider to view in overall which cities are affordable.

  <div class="card">
    <h5>What is the trend of prices of renting a home compared to buying a house for a given state?</h5>
    <p class="subtitle">Rent vs. Sales</p>
    <p>
      After entering a state of interest, you can view the general trends of renting a home monthly compared to the general trends of buying a home. You can use this graph to generalize how much to expect prices of either renting/buying will change, as well as gain some insight on whether renting or buying would be more suited for you.

    <h5>What are the trends of monthly rent in different states by housing types?</h5>
    <p class="subtitle">Rent trend plot</p>
    <p>
      After filtering what state, city, and home types you're interested in retrieving data for, the graph outputs a line graph of the median monthly rent from 2010 - 2019. You can use this graph to extrapolate what type of housing will be cheap or expensive in the state you'd like to live in for the next several years.
